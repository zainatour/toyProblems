//Arrays have a native method called forEach: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
//Write a function that acts like the native method
//eg:
//forEach ([1,2,3], function (x) {
//  console.log(x);
//})
//>1
//>2
//>3

function forEach (list, fn) {
    //code here
}
